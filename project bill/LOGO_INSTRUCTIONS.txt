              HOW TO ADD YOUR LOGO TO BILLS
================================================================================

To show your logo as a watermark on all bills, follow these steps:

STEP 1: Save your logo file
---------------------------
1. Save your logo image as: logo.png
2. The logo should be:
   - PNG format (recommended)
   - Square shape works best (same width and height)
   - Minimum size: 500 x 500 pixels
   - Maximum size: 1000 x 1000 pixels

STEP 2: Place the logo file
---------------------------
1. Copy your logo.png file
2. Paste it in this folder: "project bill"
   (Same folder where START_APP.bat is located)

STEP 3: Restart the application
-------------------------------
1. Close the billing software (if open)
2. Double-click START_APP.bat to restart
3. Your logo will now appear as a watermark!

================================================================================
WHERE TO FIND YOUR LOGO
================================================================================

Your logo should be saved at:
"project bill/logo.png"

The file MUST be named exactly: logo.png (lowercase)
